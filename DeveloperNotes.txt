This document is made by Sidney for personal use and doesn't add anything to the application.

to do:
- create table arists
- make these fields: 'artist.id (auto-increment)', 'artist.userId -> users.id (can be null)', 'artist.name', 'artist.id -> artwork.artist'
- all connections between artworks and users must be destroyed EXCEPT 'artworks.userid -> users.id'
- get all filters from artist names from artist.name (instead of filter_opties.name)
- delete * from filter_opties where filter_opties.filter_id == 1
- make this connection 'artworks.artist -> artists.id'.
- privelege 1 can reserve artworks
- privelege 2 can upload pictures to the archive.
- privelege 3 can change priveleges for every user
- artists shows all artists from the table artists.name
- artworks on the page have artist.name if exists, else '-'. if (artist.profile == 1){ go to the artists profile} else {make a page with: "deze kunstenaar heeft geen profiel" }
